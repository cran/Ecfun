# Ecfun 

Functions and vignettes to update a few data sets in 'Ecdat' and to create, manipulate, plot, and analyze some of those and similar data sets.

All `read*` functions in this package have been removed, because it wasn't clear if anyone was using them.  Other functions that called an `Ecfun::read*` function by default were also deleted, especially `UShouse.senate`, `USsenateClass`, and `mergeUShouse.senate`.  These all scraped websites, and the demand for them seemed not to justify the work of maintaining them.

`testURLs` and `read.testURLs` have been removed, 
because it wasn't clear that anyone was using them, 
and more modern tools are available from:

Thanks to IÃ±aki Ucar, Adam H Sparks, and Roy 
Mendelssohn for their replies to a question 
posted to R-Devel helped me understand what 
I needed to do to fix problems identified in 
the CRAN Checks.
