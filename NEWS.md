`financialCrisisFiles` and `readFinancialCrisisFiles` have been removed, because (a) it wasn't clear that anyone was using them, (b) the `gdata` package that was used to read them was not being maintained, and (c) the work required to read them with another package exceeded the need of the maintainer.  If you need them please so inform the maintainer.
